# Schema and migrations

Before or right after running any script in this folder that changes the database, you **must** log the change in **`docs/DB_CHANGELOG.md`** with:

- **Who** made the change
- **When** (date/time, UTC)
- **What** changed (from → to)
- **Script / How** (e.g. this script’s filename or “Manual in SSMS”)

See `docs/DB_CHANGELOG.md` for the template and instructions.
