/**
 * Deduplicate Reviews
 *
 * Finds duplicate reviews by Property + reviewer_name (normalized).
 * Keeps the OLDEST (first recorded)—preserves original dates. Never overwrites.
 * Deletes newer duplicates that slipped in before the bulk-insert skip logic.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run db:deduplicate-reviews           # Run deduplication
 *   npm run db:deduplicate-reviews -- --dry-run   # Preview only, no deletes
